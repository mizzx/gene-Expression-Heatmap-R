# gene-Expression-Heatmap-R
Gene expression analysis for two types of breast cancer drugs, with implementation of
heatmap clustering to identify upregulated and downregulated genes.

The image is a heatmap representing the results of a gene expression. From the colour key, we can see the darker colour, the more upregulated gene is, while the lighter colour, the more downregulated gene is.

Based on the color distribution in the heatmap, it appears that there are several genes that are upregulated in response to both drugs. There are also some genes that are downregulated in response to both drugs.

This method allows researchers to identify patterns of gene regulation and prioritize genes for further study.
